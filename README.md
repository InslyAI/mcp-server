### Authentication

**All 25 FormFlow tools** support **dual authentication methods** for maximum flexibility and security:

- **`clientSecret`** - FormFlow client secret  
- **`organizationId`** - FormFlow organization identifier

**Option 2: Bearer Token** (recommended for security)
- **`bearerToken`** - JWT token obtained from `formflow_exchange_token` (1-hour validity)

The server automatically handles JWT token generation, refresh, and includes rate limiting awareness (60 requests/minute). Bearer tokens provide better security by avoiding credential exposure in each request.
